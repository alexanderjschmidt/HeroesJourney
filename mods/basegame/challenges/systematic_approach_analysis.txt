ANIMATION ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:
=============================
1. Assign each animation to exactly one challenge
2. Ensure thematic appropriateness
3. Balance difficulty distribution
4. Maintain approach usage targets (25-26 each)
5. Create unique combinations for each challenge

This systematic approach ensures all 135 animations are used exactly once across 135 challenges, with perfectly balanced approach usage.
