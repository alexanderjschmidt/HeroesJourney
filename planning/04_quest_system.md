# üèÜ **Quest System**

## **Overview**

The quest system provides structured objectives that players can complete by spending renown resources. Quests offer fame rewards and stat bonuses, creating strategic choices between immediate gains and long-term development.

* **Cost** - Renown resources required to complete the quest
* **Rewards** - Renown and stat bonuses granted upon completion
* **Fame Reward** - Direct fame points earned from quest completion
* **Availability** - Conditions that determine when quests are available

    id = Ids.MY_QUEST

    cost { 
        stat(Ids.STAT_VALOR, 2) 
    }
    rewards { 
        stat(Ids.STAT_INSIGHT, 1) 
    }
}.register()

## **Quest Mechanics**

### **Quest Availability**
* Quests are generated randomly in regions with quest boards
* Each region can have 0-3 active quests at a time
* New quests are automatically generated when quest slots are empty
* Quest types are distributed based on region characteristics

### **Quest Completion**
* Players must have sufficient renown to pay the quest cost
* Costs are deducted immediately upon quest acceptance
* Rewards are granted upon successful completion
* Fame rewards provide direct victory points

### **Quest Actions**
* **Quest Board** - View available quests in a region
* **Accept Quest** - Take on a quest (costs are paid)
* **Complete Quest** - Finish an accepted quest for rewards
* **Abandon Quest** - Give up on a quest (costs are lost)

## **Quest Components**

### **QuestsComponent**

### **Quest Actions**

* **Complete Quest Action** - Processes quest completion and rewards
* **Quest Validation** - Checks if player can afford quest costs

## **Strategic Considerations**

### **Resource Management**
* **Cost vs. Reward** - Evaluate whether quest rewards justify the cost
* **Renown Flow** - Balance quest spending with challenge earning
* **Stat Development** - Use quests to accelerate character progression

### **Quest Timing**
* **Early Game** - Focus on quests that develop your starting stats
* **Mid Game** - Target quests that provide needed renown types
* **Late Game** - Prioritize quests with high fame rewards

### **Competitive Aspects**
* **Quest Scarcity** - Limited quests create competition between players
* **Optimal Positioning** - Move to regions with beneficial quests
* **Resource Denial** - Complete quests to deny them to opponents
