REWARD FUNCTION DESIGN
======================

Formula: (approach_stats * character_stats) / difficulty_rating

Where:
- approach_stats = The challenge's approach stat value (e.g., MIGHT, LOGIC, SORCERY, etc.)
- character_stats = The character's corresponding base stat (BODY, MIND, MAGIC, CHARISMA)
- difficulty_rating = Base difficulty that increases with turns (starts at 1.0, increases gradually)

MINIMUM REWARDS
===============

Each approach guarantees minimum rewards regardless of character stats:

BODY-based approaches:
- MIGHT: 3 VALOR
- CHIVALRY: 2 VALOR + 1 INFLUENCE  
- SKILL: 2 VALOR + 1 INSIGHT
- EMPOWERMENT: 2 VALOR + 1 ARCANUM

MIND-based approaches:
- CONCENTRATION: 3 INSIGHT
- WISDOM: 2 INSIGHT + 1 ARCANUM
- STUDY: 2 INSIGHT + 1 INFLUENCE
- INTUITION: 2 INSIGHT + 1 VALOR

MAGIC-based approaches:
- SORCERY: 3 ARCANUM
- ENCHANTMENT: 2 ARCANUM + 1 INSIGHT
- RITUAL: 2 ARCANUM + 1 INFLUENCE
- MYSTICISM: 2 ARCANUM + 1 VALOR

CHARISMA-based approaches:
- CHARM: 3 INFLUENCE
- PERSUASION: 2 INFLUENCE + 1 INSIGHT
- MESMERISM: 2 INFLUENCE + 1 ARCANUM
- DIPLOMACY: 2 INFLUENCE + 1 VALOR

OVERFLOW SYSTEM
===============

When calculated rewards exceed minimums:
1. Minimum rewards are guaranteed
2. Excess rewards come from realm attention (if available)
3. If realm attention is insufficient, rewards are capped

Example: CHIVALRY with high stats
- Minimum: 2 VALOR + 1 INFLUENCE
- Calculated: 5 VALOR + 3 INFLUENCE  
- Available realm attention: 4 VALOR, 2 INFLUENCE
- Final reward: 2 VALOR (min) + 3 VALOR (from attention) + 1 INFLUENCE (min) + 2 INFLUENCE (from attention) = 5 VALOR + 3 INFLUENCE

STAT MAPPINGS
=============
Base Stats -> Renown Rewards:
- BODY -> VALOR (combat/physical achievements)
- MIND -> INSIGHT (knowledge/discovery achievements)  
- MAGIC -> ARCANUM (magical/mystical achievements)
- CHARISMA -> INFLUENCE (social/diplomatic achievements)

EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
====================

CHARACTER STATS EXAMPLE:
Character has: BODY=2, MIND=1, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1
(Note: Characters start with 2 in one stat, 1 in the other three)
(Characters gain ~1 stat per 5 turns through actions like workout/study)

DIFFICULTY RATINGS (Progressive Scaling):
- Turn 1-10:  Difficulty = 1.5 (max first turn reward = 4)
- Turn 11-20: Difficulty = 2.0
- Turn 21-30: Difficulty = 2.5
- Turn 31-40: Difficulty = 3.0
- Turn 41-50: Difficulty = 3.5
- Turn 51-60: Difficulty = 4.0
- Turn 61-70: Difficulty = 4.5
- Turn 71+:   Difficulty = 5.0 (capped to prevent excessive scaling)

SCENARIO 1: Early Game (Turn 1, Difficulty = 1.5)
==================================================

Challenge: "Defeat Goblin Fighter" 
Approaches: CHIVALRY, MIGHT, SKILL
Character: BODY=2, MIND=1, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1
Character chooses: MIGHT

MIGHT calculation: 3x BODY = 3 × 2 = 6
Calculated reward = (6) / 1.5 = 4 VALOR
Minimum reward: 3 VALOR
Available realm attention: 1 VALOR
Final reward: 3 VALOR (min) + 1 VALOR (from attention) = 4 VALOR

Alternative approaches for same challenge:
- CHIVALRY: (2×2 + 1×1) / 1.5 = 3.33 total
  - BODY components: (4) / 1.5 = 2.67 VALOR
  - CHARISMA component: (1) / 1.5 = 0.67 INFLUENCE
  - Minimum: 2 VALOR + 1 INFLUENCE
  - Final: 2 VALOR (min) + 0 VALOR (from attention) + 1 INFLUENCE (min) + 0 INFLUENCE (from attention) = 2 VALOR + 1 INFLUENCE

- SKILL: (2×2 + 1×1) / 1.5 = 3.33 total
  - BODY components: (4) / 1.5 = 2.67 VALOR  
  - MIND component: (1) / 1.5 = 0.67 INSIGHT
  - Minimum: 2 VALOR + 1 INSIGHT
  - Final: 2 VALOR (min) + 0 VALOR (from attention) + 1 INSIGHT (min) + 0 INSIGHT (from attention) = 2 VALOR + 1 INSIGHT

Approaches: CHARM, CONCENTRATION, SORCERY  
Character: BODY=2, MIND=2, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=1
(Character gained 2 stats over 11 turns - focused on MIND/MAGIC)
Character chooses: SORCERY

SORCERY calculation: 3x MAGIC = 3 × 2 = 6
Calculated reward = (6) / 2.0 = 3.0 ARCANUM (rounds up to 3)
Minimum reward: 3 ARCANUM
Available realm attention: 1 ARCANUM
Final reward: 3 ARCANUM (min) + 0 ARCANUM (from attention) = 3 ARCANUM

Alternative approaches:
- CHARM: (3×1) / 1.2 = 2.5 INFLUENCE
  - Minimum: 3 INFLUENCE
  - Final: 3 INFLUENCE (minimum guaranteed)

- CONCENTRATION: (2×2 + 1×1) / 1.2 = 4.17 total
  - MIND components: (4) / 1.2 = 3.33 INSIGHT
  - MAGIC component: (1) / 1.2 = 0.83 ARCANUM
  - Minimum: 3 INSIGHT
  - Final: 3 INSIGHT (min) + 0 ARCANUM (too small) = 3 INSIGHT

SCENARIO 3: Late Game (Turn 25, Difficulty = 2.5)
==================================================

Challenge: "Duel Pit Balor"
Approaches: BRAVADO, CHARM, MIGHT
Character: BODY=4, MIND=3, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=3
(Character gained 5 stats over 24 turns - focused on BODY/CHARISMA)
Character chooses: BRAVADO

BRAVADO calculation: 2x CHARISMA + 1x BODY = (2×3 + 1×4) = 10
Calculated reward = (10) / 2.5 = 4.0 total
- CHARISMA components: (6) / 2.5 = 2.4 INFLUENCE (rounds up to 3)
- BODY component: (4) / 2.5 = 1.6 VALOR (rounds up to 2)
- Minimum: 2 INFLUENCE + 1 VALOR
- Available realm attention: 2 INFLUENCE, 1 VALOR
- Final: 2 INFLUENCE (min) + 1 INFLUENCE (from attention) + 1 VALOR (min) + 1 VALOR (from attention) = 3 INFLUENCE + 2 VALOR

Alternative approaches:
- CHARM: (3×3) / 2.5 = 3.6 INFLUENCE (rounds up to 4)
  - Minimum: 3 INFLUENCE
  - Available realm attention: 2 INFLUENCE
  - Final: 3 INFLUENCE (min) + 1 INFLUENCE (from attention) = 4 INFLUENCE

- MIGHT: (3×4) / 2.5 = 4.8 VALOR (rounds up to 5)
  - Minimum: 3 VALOR
  - Available realm attention: 3 VALOR
  - Final: 3 VALOR (min) + 2 VALOR (from attention) = 5 VALOR

SCENARIO 4: Character Development Impact
========================================

Early Game Character (Turn 2, Difficulty = 1.0):
BODY=3, MIND=2, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1

Challenge: "Learn from Elf Enchanter"
Approaches: CHARM, CONCENTRATION, SORCERY
Character chooses: SORCERY

SORCERY: (3×1) / 1.0 = 3 ARCANUM

Mid Game Character (Turn 20, Difficulty = 2.5):
BODY=6, MIND=5, MAGIC=4, CHARISMA=4
(Character gained ~3-4 stats over 18 turns through workout/study actions)
Character chooses: SORCERY

SORCERY: (3×4) / 2.5 = 4.8 ARCANUM (rounds to 4)

Late Game Character (Turn 40, Difficulty = 3.0):
BODY=9, MIND=8, MAGIC=7, CHARISMA=7
(Character gained ~6-7 stats over 38 turns)
Character chooses: SORCERY

SORCERY: (3×7) / 3.0 = 7 ARCANUM

SCENARIO 5: Optimal Approach Selection
======================================

Challenge: "Negotiate with Elf Lord"
Approaches: CHARM, MESMERISM, PERSUASION
Character: BODY=5, MIND=4, MAGIC=3, CHARISMA=5
Turn: 15 (Difficulty = 2.0)

Calculations:
- CHARM: (3×5) / 2.0 = 7.5 INFLUENCE (rounds to 7)
- MESMERISM: (2×5 + 1×3) / 2.0 = 6.5 INFLUENCE (rounds to 6)
- PERSUASION: (2×5 + 1×4) / 2.0 = 7 INFLUENCE

Best choice: CHARM for 7 INFLUENCE

SCENARIO 6: Mixed Stat Character
=================================

Character: BODY=6, MIND=3, MAGIC=5, CHARISMA=4
(Character focused on BODY/MAGIC development over ~20 turns)
Challenge: "Defeat Young Red Dragon"
Approaches: BRAVADO, CHARM, EMPOWERMENT
Turn: 18 (Difficulty = 2.5)

Calculations:
- BRAVADO: (2×4 + 1×6) / 2.5 = 5.6 VALOR
- CHARM: (3×4) / 2.5 = 4.8 VALOR
- EMPOWERMENT: (2×6 + 1×5) / 2.5 = 6.8 VALOR

Best choice: EMPOWERMENT for 6 VALOR

SCENARIO 7: Dual Reward Types from Confluence Stats
===================================================

Some approaches combine multiple base stats, potentially giving rewards of two types.
The reward type is determined by the PRIMARY stat (first two components).

Character: BODY=4, MIND=3, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=5
Turn: 12 (Difficulty = 2.0)

Challenge: "Defeat Goblin Fighter"
Approaches: CHIVALRY, MIGHT, SKILL

CHIVALRY (BODY + BODY + CHARISMA) = 2×4 + 1×5 = 13
- BODY components (2×4) = 8 → VALOR reward
- CHARISMA component (1×5) = 5 → INFLUENCE reward
Rewards = (8) / 2.0 = 4 VALOR AND (5) / 2.0 = 2.5 INFLUENCE (rounds to 2)

SKILL (BODY + BODY + MIND) = 2×4 + 1×3 = 11
- BODY components (2×4) = 8 → VALOR reward  
- MIND component (1×3) = 3 → INSIGHT reward
Rewards = (8) / 2.0 = 4 VALOR AND (3) / 2.0 = 1.5 INSIGHT (rounds to 1)

MIGHT (BODY + BODY + BODY) = 3×4 = 12
- All BODY components → VALOR reward only
Reward = (12) / 2.0 = 6 VALOR

Challenge: "Learn from Elf Enchanter"
Approaches: CHARM, CONCENTRATION, SORCERY

CONCENTRATION (MIND + MIND + MAGIC) = 2×3 + 1×2 = 8
- MIND components (2×3) = 6 → INSIGHT reward
- MAGIC component (1×2) = 2 → ARCANUM reward
Rewards = (6) / 2.0 = 3 INSIGHT AND (2) / 2.0 = 1 ARCANUM

SORCERY (MAGIC + MAGIC + MAGIC) = 3×2 = 6
- Primary: MAGIC (3 components) → ARCANUM reward only
Reward = (6) / 2.0 = 3 ARCANUM

CHARM (CHARISMA + CHARISMA + CHARISMA) = 3×5 = 15
- Primary: CHARISMA (3 components) → INFLUENCE reward only
Reward = (15) / 2.0 = 7.5 INFLUENCE (rounds to 7)

SCENARIO 8: Challenge Difficulty Scaling
=========================================

Character progression over time (gaining 1 stat per 5 turns):
Turn 1:  BODY=2, MIND=1, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1
Turn 10: BODY=3, MIND=2, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1 (focused on BODY/MIND)
Turn 20: BODY=3, MIND=2, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=2 (balanced growth)
Turn 30: BODY=4, MIND=3, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=2 (continued specialization)

Same challenge: "Defeat Goblin Fighter" (MIGHT approach)
Different turns:

Turn 1:  (3×2) / 1.5 = 4 VALOR (max first turn reward)
Turn 10: (3×3) / 1.5 = 6 VALOR (rounds up to 6)
Turn 20: (3×3) / 2.0 = 4.5 VALOR (rounds up to 5)
Turn 30: (3×4) / 2.5 = 4.8 VALOR (rounds up to 5)

This shows how character growth partially offsets difficulty scaling, 
but early engagement is still rewarded due to higher relative rewards.

DUAL REWARD MECHANICS
=====================

When using confluence stats (mixed approaches), each stat component contributes to its own renown type separately:

Examples:
- SKILL (BODY+BODY+MIND): BODY components → VALOR, MIND component → INSIGHT
- CHIVALRY (BODY+BODY+CHARISMA): BODY components → VALOR, CHARISMA component → INFLUENCE
- CONCENTRATION (MIND+MIND+MAGIC): MIND components → INSIGHT, MAGIC component → ARCANUM
- EMPOWERMENT (BODY+BODY+MAGIC): BODY components → VALOR, MAGIC component → ARCANUM

Example with Separate Rewards:
Character: BODY=4, MIND=3, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=5
Challenge: "Defeat Goblin Fighter" using SKILL
Turn: 12 (Difficulty = 2.0)

SKILL calculation: 
- BODY components (2×4) = 8 → VALOR reward
- MIND component (1×3) = 3 → INSIGHT reward

Rewards = (8) / 2.0 = 4 VALOR AND (3) / 2.0 = 1.5 INSIGHT (rounds to 1)

Total reward: 4 VALOR + 1 INSIGHT

This encourages diverse character builds and strategic approach selection.

PROGRESSION RATE ANALYSIS
=========================

With characters gaining 1 stat per 5 turns (increasing one of the four stats by 1):
- Turn 5:  +1 stat (e.g., BODY=3, MIND=1, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1)
- Turn 10: +2 stats (e.g., BODY=3, MIND=2, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1)
- Turn 15: +3 stats (e.g., BODY=3, MIND=2, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=1)
- Turn 20: +4 stats (e.g., BODY=3, MIND=2, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=2)
- Turn 25: +5 stats (e.g., BODY=4, MIND=2, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=2)
- Turn 30: +6 stats (e.g., BODY=4, MIND=3, MAGIC=2, CHARISMA=2)

This creates more focused character development where players specialize in specific stats rather than balanced growth.

This creates a focused progression where:
1. Early game (Turns 1-10): Moderate rewards with guaranteed minimums
2. Mid game (Turns 11-20): Steady rewards that scale with character specialization
3. Late game (Turns 21+): Consistent rewards with realm attention overflow

The difficulty scaling (1.5 → 2.0 → 2.5 → 3.0 → 3.5 → 4.0 → 4.5 → 5.0) is designed to:
- Cap first turn rewards at 4 maximum
- Provide steady progression every 10 turns
- Prevent late-game power creep with capped difficulty
- Maintain challenge relevance with focused character development
- Enable realm attention overflow for specialized characters

IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
=============================

1. ROUNDING: Should rewards be rounded down, up, or to nearest integer?
   - Recommendation: Round up to give more chance to gain resources
   - Minimum rewards ensure players always get something

2. MINIMUM REWARDS: Each approach guarantees specific minimums
   - MIGHT: 3 VALOR, CHIVALRY: 2 VALOR + 1 INFLUENCE, etc.
   - Ensures every approach provides meaningful value
   - Prevents players from getting nothing with low stats

3. DIFFICULTY SCALING: Progressive scaling with capped maximum
   - Current: 1.5 → 2.0 → 2.5 → 3.0 → 3.5 → 4.0 → 4.5 → 5.0
   - Increases by 0.5 every 10 turns
   - Caps at 5.0 to prevent excessive late-game scaling
   - Enables max 4 reward on first turn

4. REALM ATTENTION OVERFLOW: Excess rewards come from realm attention
   - Calculated rewards above minimums require realm attention
   - If insufficient realm attention, rewards are capped at minimum
   - Makes realm attention a valuable resource for scaling

5. STARTING STATS: One stat at 2, others at 1
   - Provides clear character specialization from the start
   - Enables meaningful first-turn choices
   - Balances with minimum reward system

6. CHALLENGE VARIETY: Different challenge types could have different base difficulties
   - Easy challenges: Base difficulty 1.0
   - Normal challenges: Base difficulty 1.5  
   - Hard challenges: Base difficulty 2.0
   - Boss challenges: Base difficulty 2.5

BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS
======================

1. Early Game: Guaranteed minimum rewards ensure approach viability
2. Mid Game: Steady progression with character development offsetting difficulty
3. Late Game: Capped difficulty prevents power creep while maintaining relevance
4. Character Development: Stats directly impact reward potential through overflow system
5. Approach Choice: Minimum rewards + realm attention overflow create strategic depth
6. Realm Attention: Becomes valuable resource for scaling high-stat characters
7. First Turn: Capped at 4 maximum reward prevents early game dominance

PROGRESSIVE SCALING BENEFITS
============================

The new difficulty scaling (1.5 → 2.0 → 2.5 → 3.0 → 3.5 → 4.0 → 4.5 → 5.0) provides:

1. **Capped First Turn**: Difficulty 1.5 ensures maximum 4 reward on first turn
2. **Steady Progression**: Rewards increase by 0.5 every 10 turns
3. **Capped Late Game**: Difficulty caps at 5.0 to prevent excessive scaling
4. **Balanced Growth**: Character development partially offsets difficulty increases
5. **Realm Attention Integration**: Overflow system enables scaling for high-stat characters
6. **Generous Rounding**: Round up rewards to give more resources to players

MINIMUM REWARD BENEFITS
=======================

1. **Guaranteed Value**: Every approach provides meaningful rewards regardless of character stats
2. **Approach Diversity**: Players can choose any approach without fear of getting nothing
3. **New Player Friendly**: Even low-stat characters get rewards
4. **Strategic Choice**: Minimums create baseline expectations for planning

OVERFLOW SYSTEM BENEFITS
========================

1. **Realm Attention Integration**: Excess rewards come from realm attention, making it a valuable resource
2. **Resource Management**: Players must balance realm attention usage
3. **Scaling Rewards**: High-stat characters can still get large rewards if realm attention is available
4. **Capped Growth**: Prevents runaway reward inflation

FIRST TURN REWARD VERIFICATION
==============================

Maximum possible reward on Turn 1 (Difficulty = 1.5):
- Best approach: MIGHT (3× BODY)
- Starting stats: BODY=2, MIND=1, MAGIC=1, CHARISMA=1
- Calculation: (3 × 2) / 1.5 = 4 VALOR
- Minimum: 3 VALOR
- Available realm attention: 1 VALOR
- Final reward: 3 VALOR (min) + 1 VALOR (from attention) = 4 VALOR

This achieves the target maximum of 4 reward on the first turn.

Alternative approaches on Turn 1:
- CHIVALRY: 2 VALOR + 1 INFLUENCE (minimum only)
- SKILL: 2 VALOR + 1 INSIGHT (minimum only)
- CHARM: 3 INFLUENCE (minimum only)
- SORCERY: 3 ARCANUM (minimum only)

This ensures balanced first-turn choices with meaningful but not overwhelming rewards.

This system creates a dynamic economy where:
- Character stats directly impact reward potential
- Minimum rewards ensure approach viability
- Realm attention provides scaling mechanism
- Progressive difficulty maintains balance throughout the game
- Multiple approaches provide strategic depth
