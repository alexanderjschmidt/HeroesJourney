# 🧠 Stat Roles & Economies Overview

Your game features four core stats, each tied to a different *action style* and *resource system*. They are
asymmetrical by design to create varied play patterns and hero builds.

## 🎮 Design Implications

- **Body** = constant pressure engine
- **Arcana** = burst / timing window engine
- **Mind** = setup / support engine
- **Charisma** = meta-engine (influences economy, story, fame)

Each stat supports a different play *tempo* and *style*, encouraging replayability and creative synergy.

## 💡 Optional Ideas to Support This

- **Concentration Buff**: Spend Focus to **delay an action** and have it resolve with +50% power next turn.
- **Spellcrafting**: Arcana actions can be combined with Focus for **custom spell combos**.
- **Influence Events**: At end of each round, host a “Public Opinion” check. Most Influence spent = bonus
  Fame.
- **Body Resilience**: If you spend only Body actions in a turn, regenerate +1 extra Stamina next turn.
