# Resource Scarcity & Player Interaction - Design Summary

## Resource Pool Options

### 1. Four Resource Pools (Stamina, Focus, Mana, Moxie) + Four Renown Types
- **Pros:** Deep, thematic, allows for specialization and tactical play.
- **Cons:** High complexity, many resources to track, risk of overwhelming players and cluttering UI.

### 2. Fame + Resource Pools (No Renown Types)
- **Pros:** Simpler, easier to track, cleaner UI, still allows for strategic play via resource management and realm's attention.
- **Cons:** Less thematic differentiation, less specialization, potential for homogenized playstyles.

### 3. Hybrid/Action Point System
- **Pros:** Allows for bonus actions or powered-up moves using resource pools, keeps main action economy simple.
- **Cons:** Medium complexity, may require careful balancing.

## Realm's Attention (Global Scarcity Mechanic)
- Each turn, only a limited pool of fame (or renown) is available to be earned by all players.
- When depleted, no more can be earned that turn.
- Creates competition for resources even if players are far apart.
- Resting allows players to act earlier next turn, giving priority access to the fame pool.

## Design Options for Increasing Scarcity & Player Interaction

1. **Global Scarcity (Realm's Attention):**
   - Shared fame pool per turn. Players compete for the same fame, regardless of location.

2. **Shared Objectives / Global Events:**
   - Timed world quests or events that all players can attempt, but only one can claim the big reward.

3. **Limited Unique Rewards:**
   - Some quests, feats, or items can only be claimed by one player. Once taken, they're gone.

4. **Dynamic Map Pressure:**
   - Shrinking safe zones or wandering threats force players to move and converge.

5. **Player-Driven Scarcity:**
   - Players can block, steal, or sabotage resources, affecting others even at a distance.

6. **Market or Auction Systems:**
   - Players bid for fame or actions, creating economic competition.

7. **Endgame Triggers:**
   - A final event or boss draws all players to a single location for a climactic finish.

8. **Information Scarcity:**
   - Limited clues or rumors about high-value objectives create indirect competition.

9. **Region-Based Scarcity (Rotating Hotspots):**
   - Certain regions become more valuable each turn, encouraging players to move and interact.

## Recommendations
- Use a mix of global scarcity (realm's attention) and periodic shared objectives or map pressure to ensure player interaction.
- Consider simplifying to fame + resource pools for clarity, but reinforce playstyle identity through feats, achievements, or narrative.
- Playtest with hybrid or simplified systems before adding more complexity.
