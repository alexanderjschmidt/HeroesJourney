# ðŸŽ¯ **Core Concept**

## **Game Overview**

Heroes Journey is a **competitive, turn-based, boardgame-style RPG** where heroes race to build the greatest legend through challenges, quests, and strategic character development.

## **Primary Objective**

Players take turns acting as legendary heroes in a shared world, competing to earn the most **Fame** before the game ends. Fame is gained by completing challenges, quests, and achieving personal milestones. The player with the most Fame becomes the hero remembered in song and story.

## **Victory Conditions**

* **Fame accumulation** - Primary victory metric
* **Strategic timing** - Balance early resource gathering with late-game optimization
* **Character development** - Specialize effectively in chosen approaches
* **Resource management** - Efficient use of realm attention and character stats

## **Game Structure**

* **Turn-based** gameplay with approximately 1 hour for a full game
* Each turn represents a **full day of in-world time**
* **Turn order** is determined by character speed stats
* On a player's turn, they:
  1. **Optionally move** to a new region
  2. **Take one action** (challenge, quest, train, explore, etc.)

## **Core Gameplay Loop**

1. **Choose Action** - Select from available actions:
   * **Face Challenge** - Choose approach and gain renown
   * **Complete Quest** - Spend renown to complete objectives
   * **Enhance Self** - Spend renown to improve stats (workout, study, etc.)
   * **Travel** - Move to neighboring region
   * **Other Actions** - Explore, gather information, etc.

2. **Execute Action** - Perform the chosen action:
   * **For Challenges**: Select approach (MIGHT, CHIVALRY, etc.) and gain renown
   * **For Quests**: Spend required renown to complete
   * **For Enhancement**: Spend renown to increase stats
   * **For Travel**: Move to adjacent region

3. **Manage Resources** - Balance renown spending vs. gaining
4. **Strategic Planning** - Position for future opportunities
5. **End Turn** - Pass control to next player

## **Strategic Depth**

### **Character Specialization**
* **Focused builds** - Players must choose which stats to develop
* **Approach optimization** - Different approaches reward different renown types
* **Predictable rewards** - Fixed approach rewards enable strategic planning

### **Temporal Strategy**
* **Early game** - Establish character direction and gather resources
* **Mid game** - Optimize approach selection and manage realm attention
* **Late game** - Position for final challenges and maximize fame gains

### **Spatial Strategy**
* **Movement planning** - Navigate to optimal regions for challenges
* **Feature positioning** - Access special locations and quest opportunities
* **Competitive positioning** - Race for challenges and strategic locations 

## **Realm's Attention: Shared Renown Pool**

Each turn, the world provides a limited pool of each type of renownâ€”**Valor, Insight, Arcanum, Influence**â€”known as the **realm's attention**. When players earn renown from challenges or quests, it is drawn from this shared pool. If a particular type of renown is depleted for the turn, players cannot earn more of that type until the next round.

This system creates direct competition for specific renown types. Players must pay attention to which types are still available and may need to adapt their strategy, either by seeking out less-contested renown or by choosing to **rest**. Resting allows a player to act earlier in the next turn order, giving them priority access to the realm's attention and first pick of available renown.

This adds a dynamic, interactive layer to resource management and turn planning, rewarding players who can anticipate opponents' moves and adapt to the evolving state of the realm's attention.
