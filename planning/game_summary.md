* **Registry system** - Centralized registration for all game content
* **Hot-reloading** - Mods can be reloaded without restarting the game
* **Unified mod structure** - Single main mod file that includes all content files

### **Mod Loading System**
* **`ScriptModLoader`** - Intelligent mod discovery and loading system
* **`mod.kts` convention** - Only files named `mod.kts` are treated as main mod files
* **Fast discovery** - Skips non-mod files during initial scan for improved performance
* **Strict validation** - Ensures `mod.kts` files return proper `GameMod` objects
* **Parallel loading** - Optional parallel script loading for improved performance
* **Directory loading** - Load all `.kts` files from a directory with `includeScriptsFromDirectory()`

### **Basegame Mod** (`mods/basegame/mod.kts`)
The core mod containing all essential game content, structured as a unified mod that includes all content files:

**Main Mod File:**
* **`mod.kts`** - Main mod file that returns a `GameMod` object and includes all other content

**Content Files (included by main mod):**
* **`actions/`** - Player actions and abilities organized by category:
  * `core_actions.kts` - Basic actions (workout, study, etc.)
  * `challenge_actions.kts` - Challenge-related actions
  * `travel_actions.kts` - Movement and exploration actions
  * `delve_actions.kts` - Dungeon and exploration actions
  * `options_actions.kts` - Menu and UI actions
* **`quests.kts`** - Quest definitions and completion logic
* **`items.kts`** - Item definitions, properties, and effects
* **`textures.kts`** - Animation and sprite definitions for all 135 challenges
* **`terrains.kts`** - Terrain type definitions and properties

**Challenge Categories:**
* **`challenges/`** - 9 subdirectories containing 135 total challenges:
  * `demon_challenges.kts` - 15 Demon challenges
  * `dragon_challenges.kts` - 15 Dragon challenges

* **Parallel processing** - Optional multithreaded loading for improved performance
* **Error handling** - Comprehensive error reporting and timeout protection
* **Debug logging** - Detailed logging for mod loading process

### **Mod Development Workflow**
* **Content creation** - Define challenges, actions, items using Kotlin DSL
* **Modular organization** - Separate content into logical files and directories
* **Unified loading** - Single main mod file includes all content files
* **Asset integration** - Link sprites and animations to game content
* **Balance testing** - Iterate on approach usage and reward distribution
* **Thematic consistency** - Ensure descriptions match animations and approaches

### **Completed Code Reorganization**
**Successfully moved from `initializers/` folder to proper mod structure:**

**Actions → Basegame Mod:**
* ✅ **Actions** - Moved from `initializers/actions/` to `mods/basegame/actions/`
