* **`mod.kts` convention** - Only files named `mod.kts` are treated as main mod files
* **Fast discovery** - Skips non-mod files during initial scan for improved performance
* **Strict validation** - Ensures `mod.kts` files return proper `GameMod` objects
* **Parallel loading** - Optional parallel script loading for improved performance
* **Directory loading** - Load all `.kts` files from a directory with `includeScriptsFromDirectory()`

### **Basegame Mod** (`mods/basegame/mod.kts`)
The core mod containing all essential game content, structured as a unified mod that includes all content files:

**Main Mod File:**
* **`mod.kts`** - Main mod file that returns a `GameMod` object and includes all other content

**Content Files (included by main mod):**
* **`actions/`** - Player actions and abilities organized by category:
  * `core_actions.kts` - Basic actions (workout, study, etc.)
  * `challenge_actions.kts` - Challenge-related actions
  * `travel_actions.kts` - Movement and exploration actions
  * `delve_actions.kts` - Dungeon and exploration actions
